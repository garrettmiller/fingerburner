Upgrade to Python 2.7.10

Installing pip
http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installing/

Installing pyOpenSSL (and if you see InsecurePlatformWarning, try again)
sudo pip install pyOpenSSL

Installing mitmproxy
sudo pip install mitmproxy

Test installation by running:
pydoc libmproxy.protocol.http.HTTPRequest
If you can view the document for HTTPRequest object then you have installed
everything successfully.

Run the proxy on your local computer with the detect.py (from repo)
mitmproxy -s detect.py

Visit a few webpages, and check the logs file (generated by the script,
so read the script), and examine the logs to see which site perform font
fingerprinting. We need a lot more work in this script, but this is a way to
get started.

Documentation on the proxy library:
https://mitmproxy.org/doc/scripting/inlinescripts.html

Install mitm certificate on browser to intercept HTTPS traffic:
mitmproxy generates its own self-signed cert the first time it run in ~/.mitm/*

For Firefox on OS X, go to browser Preferences > Advanced > Network > Certificates 
and import mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem in the above folder in order to capture HTTP 
traffic.
